lensfunpy
=========

lensfunpy is an easy-to-use Python wrapper for the lensfun_ library.

`API Documentation <https://letmaik.github.io/lensfunpy/api/>`_

Sample code
-----------

How to find cameras and lenses:

.. code-block:: python

    import lensfunpy

    cam_maker = 'NIKON CORPORATION'
    cam_model = 'NIKON D3S'
    lens_maker = 'Nikon'
    lens_model = 'Nikkor 28mm f/2.8D AF'

    db = lensfunpy.Database()
    cam = db.find_cameras(cam_maker, cam_model)[0]
    lens = db.find_lenses(cam, lens_maker, lens_model)[0]
    
    print(cam)
    # Camera(Maker: NIKON CORPORATION; Model: NIKON D3S; Variant: ; 
    #        Mount: Nikon F AF; Crop Factor: 1.0; Score: 0)
    
    print(lens)
    # Lens(Maker: Nikon; Model: Nikkor 28mm f/2.8D AF; Type: RECTILINEAR;
    #      Focal: 28.0-28.0; Aperture: 2.79999995232-2.79999995232; 
    #      Crop factor: 1.0; Score: 110)    

How to correct lens distortion:

.. code-block:: python

    import cv2 # OpenCV library
    
    focal_length = 28.0
    aperture = 1.4
    distance = 10
    image_path = '/path/to/image.tiff'
    undistorted_image_path = '/path/to/image_undist.tiff'
    
    im = cv2.imread(image_path)
    height, width = im.shape[0], im.shape[1]
    
    mod = lensfunpy.Modifier(lens, cam.crop_factor, width, height)
    mod.initialize(focal_length, aperture, distance)
    
    undist_coords = mod.apply_geometry_distortion()
    im_undistorted = cv2.remap(im, undist_coords, None, cv2.INTER_LANCZOS4)
    cv2.imwrite(undistorted_image_path, im_undistorted)
    
It is also possible to apply the correction via `SciPy <http://www.scipy.org>`_ instead of OpenCV.
The `lensfunpy.util <https://letmaik.github.io/lensfunpy/api/lensfunpy.util.html>`_ module
contains convenience functions for RGB images which handle both OpenCV and SciPy.

How to correct lens vignetting:

.. code-block:: python

    import lensfunpy
    import imageio

    db = lensfun.Database()
    cam = db.find_cameras('NIKON CORPORATION', 'NIKON D3S')[0]
    lens = db.find_lenses(cam, 'Nikon', 'Nikkor AF 20mm f/2.8D')[0]

    img = imageio.imread('/path/to/image.tiff')

    focal_length = 20
    aperture = 4
    distance = 10
    width = img.shape[1]
    height = img.shape[0]

    mod = lensfunpy.Modifier(lens, cam.crop_factor, width, height)
    mod.initialize(focal_length, aperture, distance)

    did_apply = mod.apply_color_modification(img)
    if did_apply:
        imageio.imwrite('corrected.tiff', img)
    else:
        print('vignetting not corrected, calibration data missing?')


Installation
------------

Install lensfunpy by running:
```sh
pip install lensfunpy
```

64-bit binary wheels are provided for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

Installation from source on Linux/macOS
---------------------------------------

If you have the need to use a specific lensfun version or you can't use the provided binary wheels
then follow the steps in this section to build lensfunpy from source.

First, install the lensfun_ library on your system.

On Ubuntu, you can get (an outdated) version with:

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo apt-get install liblensfun-dev
    
Or install the latest developer version from the Git repository:

.. code-block:: sh

    git clone https://github.com/lensfun/lensfun
    cd lensfun
    cmake .
    sudo make install
    
After that, install lensfunpy using:

.. code-block:: sh

    git clone https://github.com/letmaik/lensfunpy
    cd lensfunpy
    pip install numpy cython
    pip install .
    
On Linux, if you get the error "ImportError: liblensfun.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"
when trying to use lensfunpy, then do the following:

.. code-block:: sh

    echo "/usr/local/lib" | sudo tee /etc/ld.so.conf.d/99local.conf
    sudo ldconfig

The lensfun library is installed in ``/usr/local/lib`` when compiled from source, and apparently this folder is not searched
for libraries by default in some Linux distributions.
Note that on some systems the installation path may be slightly different, such as ``/usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu``
or ``/usr/local/lib64``.

Installation from source on Windows
-----------------------------------

These instructions are experimental and support is not provided for them.
Typically, there should be no need to build manually since wheels are hosted on PyPI.

You need to have Visual Studio installed to build lensfunpy.

In a PowerShell window:

.. code-block:: sh

    $env:USE_CONDA = '1'
    $env:PYTHON_VERSION = '3.7'
    $env:PYTHON_ARCH = 'x86_64'
    $env:NUMPY_VERSION = '1.14.*'
    git clone https://github.com/letmaik/lensfunpy
    cd lensfunpy
    .github/scripts/build-windows.ps1

The above will download all build dependencies (including a Python installation)
and is fully configured through the four environment variables.
Set ``USE_CONDA = '0'`` to build within an existing Python environment.

NumPy Dependency
----------------

lensfunpy depends on NumPy. The minimum supported NumPy version depends on your Python version:

========== =========
Python     numpy
---------- ---------
3.7        >= 1.14
3.8        >= 1.17 
3.9        >= 1.19
3.10       >= 1.21
3.11       >= 1.23
